# project_info this is the project name.
This is the list of projects information template project which is using MySQL as DB, Python as Backend and React JS as Frontend.

Procedure to develop a new project:

1. Project Planning and Requirement Gathering

	Define the project scope: Timeline and technical requirements
	Functional and Non functional requirements
	Technology stack
	
2.Define the Architecture & Plan the System
	
	Determine Component Structure : Reusable components
	State Management : Session
	API Integration : backend APIs (REST, GraphQL).
	Authentication and Authorization:
	Testing Strategy: Unit tests 
	
3.Set Up the Development Environment

	Version Control: GitHub, codecloud, BitBucket
	CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions, ADO pipeline
	Code Formatting & Linting: Prettier for code formatting and ESLint for linting
	Branching Strategy: master and feature branches
	
4.Break Down Tasks and Assign Work to Developers

	Developer 1 (Frontend Focused - UI/UX, Component Development):
		• Task 1: Set up the React.js project using create-react-app or a custom Webpack setup.
		• Task 2: Develop the layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar).
		• Task 3: Implement routing with React Router.
		• Task 4: Create reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards).
		• Task 5: Implement responsive design (Mobile-first design).
		• Task 6: Develop the frontend UI based on the design mockups (using a CSS framework or custom styles).
	
	
5.Development Phase
	Initial Setup:
	Component module Development:
	Unit testing
	
6.Quality Assurance and Testing
	Unit Testing:
	Integration Testing: 
	End-to-End Testing:
	Cross-Browser Testing:
	Performance Testing: (e.g., lazy loading)
	
7.Code Review & Merge

8. Deployment and Launch
	• Set Up Deployment Pipeline: If using CI/CD, configure the pipeline to deploy the app to a staging environment.
	• Production Deployment: After successful testing, deploy to production.
	• Monitor After Launch: Use monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, Google Analytics) to track errors and user behaviour. 

9. Post-Launch & Maintenance

	• Bug Fixes: Address any bugs or issues reported by users.
	• Enhancements: Based on user feedback, work on feature enhancements.
	• Updates: Keep dependencies up to date and address security patches.
	• Performance Optimization: Regularly monitor the performance of the application and optimize where necessary.

10.Communication and Collaboration Tools:

	Task Management: iTrack, JIRA etc.
	Code Collaboration : GitHub, codeCloud, Azure devOps
	Communication : Daily standUps to discuss 
	Documentation: Maintain documentation (using tools like Confluence, or GitHub Wiki) for the architecture, setup process, and development standards.
	
	Agile Workflow: Team works in sprints and delivers small.
